# Galaxy Shooter

## You can play the game at: https://sharemygame.com/@cristopherb95/galaxy-shooter

Game was created with unity. Try to shoot enemies, collect powerups and get your own highest score! Development was done for desktop in mind, so WebGL build can be a bit laggy.

### Game Controls:
* Movement: WSAD or arrow keys
* Shoot: Space
* Pause: P
* Exit game: ESC

Spawn rate of enemies increases with time, as well as their speed. You can collect three different kinds of power ups:
* Shield
* Triple Shoot
* Speed Boost
